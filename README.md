# Habit Tracker
This is intended to be the server part for a future web application to track your habits.

## Methodology
I intend to use TDD and try to keep the things simple as much as possible.

## ToDo and/or ideas

* Define app structure.
* Define app database. I am really interested in PostgreSQL using [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise). Maybe MongoDB with [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/index.html).
* Create models to handle database transactions.
* Create a layer between routes and models to do some logic (if needed).

## Future ToDo and/or ideas
* Create a web client in a separate repository.
* Deployment using Heroku or OpenShift?.
